    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <!--Would center with a border, shadow-->

    <p>As I stated on the index page,
    I am a first year, first semester student at SAIT,
    majoring in Graphic Design. I've lived in Calgary my entire
    life, born and raised in the same house I currently live in. <br></p>
        <h3>Pets</h3>
        <!--Would center, no border, shadow-->
        <p>
        I have 2 cats, sisters, who are 8 years old. We got them
        for free from my barn, and one of them has been the most expensive
        cat we've ever owned.

    <p>
        In addition to my cats, I have a horse. She's, also, 8 years old.
        I bought her as a 6 year old in Saskatchewan. She's an off the track
        thoroughbred and raced for 2 years, earning about $11,000 dollars
        in her career.

        Education </h3>
        <!--Would center, shadow-->
        <p>
            I've completed high school, with initial plans of becoming
            a vet tech. After experiencing some incidents in both my work
            and personal life, I decided that it wasn't the career path I wanted
            to take. Instead, I decided to put my creativity to good use and 
            took the graphic design route. Don't regret that decision one bit.
